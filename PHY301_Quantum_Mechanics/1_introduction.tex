\section{Introduction}
Quantum: quantities can vary by discrete amounts.\\
Mechanics: study of motion.

\subsection{Franklin's Oil-Drop Experiment}
Spilled a spoonful (2 $ml$) of oil on the surface of a lake and extended to about 2000 $m^2$, but not more.
This experiment shows the \textbf{existent} and \textbf{size} of atoms.
$$
    \begin{gathered}
        V=S h \\
        h=\frac{V}{S} \sim \frac{2 \times 10^{-6}}{2 \times 10^{3}} \mathrm{~m} \sim 10^{-9} \mathrm{~m}
    \end{gathered}
$$
Atomic and molecular scales are \textbf{nanometric}


\subsection{From Classical Mechanics to Quantum Mechanics}
In classical mechanics, position is a function of time. \textbf{Deterministic}.\\
In quantum mechanics, the position of a particle is a random variable. \textbf{Probabilistic}.
